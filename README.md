About me:  Hi, I’m a hands-on operations leader and former sales manager with a background in trucking logistics, customer service, and business development. I spent nearly 20 years running day-to-day operations at H. Hamilton Trucking—managing dispatch, keeping things running smoothly, and making sure deliveries were safe, on time, and done right.

Later, I stepped into a sales manager role at Magic Automotive, where I used data and customer feedback to boost sales and streamline how we did business. I’ve always enjoyed solving problems, understanding what people need, and finding better ways to get results.

Now I’m shifting gears into tech. I’m currently working on the Google Data Analytics Certificate and studying computer programming (Java, JavaScript, MySQL, AWS). I’m looking to bring my real-world experience and growing technical skills into a role in IT support or data analytics—somewhere I can keep learning, help people, and make an impact.
